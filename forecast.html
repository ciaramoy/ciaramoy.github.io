<b>Welcome to the weather forecast.</b>
<br> From the name of this page you might assume that you will find out weather conditions in advance.
 <br>Not a bad conclusion since the word forecast is comprised of "cast" and "fore", so you can say you are going to cast a or predict an outcome before hand.
 <br>So yes. You are right. This page should show you future conditions.
 However you forget one essential truth. 
<br><b>This is the future.</b>
<br> This is the time which brings forth infinite outcomes. And with each passing moment your actions cement these outcomes into one definitive memory. 
<br>It is for this reason you will only be told about the physical state around you now. 
<br>So with your sense of discernment, taking into context what outcomes are possible now, it is hoped you take great action in crafting your future
<br>…
<br>
<br>Or perhaps forget.
<br> Forget the constraints of reality.
<br>After all, the only proof of reality is within your mind. Therefore, your only constraints exist only if you think it does.
<br>So forget them.
<br> Perhaps certain realities are unattainable from where you stand. Yet,
<br><span style="float:left; transform: skewX(25deg);"> if you move a little to the left,</span>
<br><span style="float:right; transform: skewX(-25deg);">or perhaps a little to the right,</span>
<br><span style="font-size:40px;">or even a few feet forward,</span>
<br><span style="font-size:15px;">or maybe if you take a step back</span>
<br>you might be closer to the reality you seek.
<br> A change in perspective is all you need.
<br>Now take control, whatever you think it to be, let it be,
<br>This is the most accurate forecast because it's what you believe,
<br>or perhaps simply a digital representation of pathetic fallacy,
<br>Either way you are in charge of what you see.
